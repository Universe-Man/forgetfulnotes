Welcome to Forgetful Notes!

To run locally, run "npm install" and then "npm run dev" in your terminal.

You can find the project running at http://localhost:3000 in the browser of your choice.

You can create notes by typing and submitting them in the text bar. The application will do its best to remember them, but after about 3 notes or more, it starts to become forgetful.

This app was build with React and Next as a Single Page Application.

<!-- FUTURE DEVELOPMENT PLANS:
1) SCRAMBLING WORDS AND HAVING MORE LEVELS OF FORGETFULNESS
2) ADD SOUND EFFECTS AND VISUAL ANIMATIONS
3) ADD A "PERSON OR ROBOT" ENTITY AS THE NOTE TAKER (REACT TO MORE NOTES)
4) NOTE REPLACEMENT LOOP WORK TO BE FIXED IN NOTESFORM ON LINE 33
5) OTHERS? -->
